# VR Golf Motor Imagery

Welcome to VR Golf Motor Imagery! This research project explores the effects of [Motor Imagery](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphysparis.2006.03.012) when visualizing and controlling the result of the imagery process in Virtual Reality.
The sport selected for this project is Golf.
The goal is to test the following:

1. If controlled virtual feedback can enhance learning
2. How different error rates affect rate of learning

This project is a joint collaboration between The Neuroplasticity, Imagery, and Motor Behaviour Laboratory ([NIMBL](https://thenimbl.com/)) in conducting the psychology research experiment and The Okanagan Visualization and Interaction Lab ([OVI](https://ovi.ok.ubc.ca/)) on developing the VR application and data collection mechanism.

This is currently ongoing unpublished research. To cite this work, please use the [Citation](https://github.com/ovi-lab/VRGolfMotorImagery/blob/master/CITATION.cff) file provided.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need

- A working Meta Quest 2, 3 or Pro, with two fully charged controllers
- A working machine to connect to the headset, for setting the configuration files and fetching the data

## Usage

The usage of the application (along with troubleshooting guidelines) can be explored in extensive detail in the following document:
